# üçè GraphRAG: KG-Enhanced LLM
This repository contains my investigations of recent research papers related to Graph RAG, conducted during July to August 2024.

- Initially, I practiced the basic implementations of deep learning by following the *Dive into Deep Learning* book ([link](https://github.com/ohmyksh/d2l-practice)).  
- Following that, I surveyed major and recent papers in the area of graph RAG, which I am particularly interested in, and selected a few for deeper analysis.

### ü§î Knowledge Graph + LLM? 
GraphRAG is an enhancement of the widely-used RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach. It incorporates a graph database as a source of contextual information that is fed into the Large Language Model (LLM). This method leverages the structured and factual nature of knowledge graphs, using them either as a reasoning source or as a database for retrieval. Graph RAG further improves the accuracy, reliability, and traceability of the model‚Äôs reasoning process by incorporating graph databases as sources of contextual information.  

üå± I am interested in research that utilizes knowledge graphs to enhance the reasoning capabilities and accuracy of LLMs, with a particular focus on exploring solutions to advance this field.

  
The investigation process was as follows:
1. **In-depth Paper Review:** I thoroughly read and summarized the papers at the implementation level to identify the key components to implement. Also, I presented the paper using the following slides.  
2. **Pseudocode Development:** Based on the papers, I created detailed pseudocode.
3. **Implementation (selectively):** I then proceeded with the implementation based on the developed pseudocode.
- Due to resource constraints (time and cost), I was unable to fully replicate the results of the paper. However, I have documented the process during the implementation process.
